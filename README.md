# Wood Smith 2 Google Actions Project

## Development

Quick overview: We use Google Actions SDK to define our scenes, intents, types, etc., which is basically
the dialog pattern for the Google Assistant. These are defined in the `sdk/` directory. Some of these are
configured to delegate to a webhook to do some work. We're deploying
firebase functions to serve those webhooks. The entire firebase application is the root project directory,
but the webhook functions are defined specifically as "Firebase Functions", under the `functions/`
directory.

The files for the Google Action SDK are _generated_ from the files in `sdk/`, but should be deployed
from `build/sdk/`, which is generated by running `npm run generate`. This scans the files in `sdk/`
and copies YAML files over verbatim, but import any JS files it finds and generates a corresponding
YAML file from the default export of the module.

You need to have the gactions-cli installed.
